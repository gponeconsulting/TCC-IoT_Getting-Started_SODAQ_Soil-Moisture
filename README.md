# moisture sensor (sodaq)
This guide is a continuation of the `Sodaq Explorer Guide` and will make use of the application and device set up during the guide.
## What you will need
To follow this guide, you will need the following:
- A SODAQ ExpLoRer which can be bought [here](https://shop.sodaq.com/explorerrn2903a-us.html)
- A micro usb connector which is included with the SODAQ ExpLoRer
- A [I2C Soil moisture sensor](https://www.tindie.com/products/miceuz/i2c-soil-moisture-sensor/)
- 4 wires
- A computer to connect to the SODAQ ExpLoRer and write the code

You will also need to be in range of a Gateway connected to The Things Network which you can find out about [here](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/community).

## Step 1 - Install Library
- Install the library by going to `Tools > Manage Libraries`
- Search for `I2CSoilMoistureSensor` using the searchbox
- Install the `I2CSoilMoistureSensor` library

## step 2 - setup the board
- Using a wire connect one of the GND ports on the SODAQ ExpLoRer to the GND port on the I2C Soil moisture sensor.
- Using a wire connect one of the SCL ports on the SODAQ ExpLoRer to the SCK/SCL port on the I2C Soil moisture sensor.
- Using a wire connect one of the SDA ports on the SODAQ ExpLoRer to the SDA/MOSI port on the I2C Soil moisture sensor.
- Using a wire connect one of the 5V ports on the SODAQ ExpLoRer to the VCC port on the I2C Soil moisture sensor.

## step 3 - write the code
Now that the sensor is connected to the SODAQ ExpLoRer, the code needs to be modified from the `Sodaq Explorer Guide` to send the sensor data instead of the button input.

- Under the line `#include <TheThingsNetwork.h>` at the top of the code add the following lines
```
#include <I2CSoilMoistureSensor.h>
#include <Wire.h>
I2CSoilMoistureSensor sensor;
```
- In the `void setup()` function add `Wire.begin();` above the `loraSerial.begin(57600);` line
- Replace the `pinMode(BUTTON, INPUT);` line with the following code
```
sensor.begin(); // reset sensor
delay(1000); // give some time to boot up
debugSerial.print("I2C Soil Moisture Sensor Address: ");
debugSerial.println(sensor.getAddress(),HEX);
debugSerial.print("Sensor Firmware version: ");
debugSerial.println(sensor.getVersion(),HEX);
debugSerial.println();
```
This will reset the soil moisture sensor and display the I2C address and firmware version in the serial monitor

- Next, in the `void loop()` function replace the following code section:
```
  // Prepare payload of 1 byte to indicate LED status
  byte payload[1];
  payload[0] = (digitalRead(BUTTON) == HIGH) ? 1 : 0;
```
with the following code:

```
        while (sensor.isBusy()) delay(50);
        int soilMoistureCapacitance = sensor.getCapacitance();
        int temperature = sensor.getTemperature();
        int light = sensor.getLight(true);
        sensor.sleep(); //sleep the sensor to save power
        
        debugSerial.print("Soil Moisture Capacitance: ");
        debugSerial.print(soilMoistureCapacitance); //read capacitance register
        debugSerial.print(", Temperature: ");
        debugSerial.print(temperature /(float)10); //temperature register
        debugSerial.print(", Light: ");
        debugSerial.println(light); //request light measurement, wait and read light register
  
        //Break the soilMoistureCapacitance, temperature and light into Bytes in individual buffer arrays
        byte payloadA[2];
        payloadA[0] = highByte(soilMoistureCapacitance);
        payloadA[1] = lowByte(soilMoistureCapacitance);
        byte payloadB[2]; 
        payloadB[0] = highByte(temperature);
        payloadB[1] = lowByte(temperature);
        byte payloadC[2]; 
        payloadC[0] = highByte(light);
        payloadC[1] = lowByte(light);

        //Get the size of each buffer array (in this case it will always be 2, but this could be used if they were variable)
        int sizeofPayloadA = sizeof(payloadA);
        int sizeofPayloadB = sizeof(payloadB);
        int sizeofPayloadC = sizeof(payloadC);

        //Make a buffer array big enough for all the values
        byte payload[sizeofPayloadA + sizeofPayloadB + sizeofPayloadC];
        
        //Add each of the individual buffer arrays the single large buffer array
        memcpy(payload, payloadA, sizeofPayloadA);
        memcpy(payload + sizeofPayloadA, payloadB, sizeofPayloadB);
        memcpy(payload + sizeofPayloadA + sizeofPayloadB, payloadC, sizeofPayloadC);
```
### What does this code do?
This code will first wait until the sensor is not busy. Then it will record the soil moisture capacitance, temperature, and light readings from the sensor.
Next it will display the values in the serial monitor so they can be checked easily.
Finally, the code goes through a process to convert the values from numbers into a payload made of a buffer array that can be sent to The Things Network. Find out more about this process [here](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/devices/bytes.html).

## Step 4 - Decoding the message
Now that we have encoded the message and sent it to The Things Network we need to tell The Things Network what to do with it.

- In your application on The Things Network, go to the tab named `Payload Formats`

- In here we can write code to decrypt the data we get from our device.
- Enter the following into the decoder
```
function Decoder(bytes, port) {
  // Decode an uplink message from a buffer
  var decoded = {};
  //Separate the individual numbers into individual buffers
  var Val1 = bytes.slice(0, 2);
  var Val2 = bytes.slice(2, 4);
  var Val3 = bytes.slice(4, 6);
  
  //Convert the buffers into numbers and divide by 100 to return them to 2 decimal places
  //Then save them to the decoded array
  decoded.myValA = ((Val1[0] << 8) + Val1[1]);
  decoded.myValB = ((Val2[0] << 8) + Val2[1]) / 10;
  decoded.myValC = ((Val3[0] << 8) + Val3[1]);

  //return the values
  return {
    field1: decoded.myValA,
    field2: decoded.myValB,
    field3: decoded.myValC,
  };
}
```
The Code first separates the long buffer array we created in step 3 into the buffers that make up the soil moisture capacitance, temperature, and light readings.
It then decodes each of the buffers into numbers, divides the temperature by 10 to turn it into a decimal number and saves them into the decoded array.
Finally the numbers are returned as field 1, field 2 and field 3.

- Click the `Save payload functions` button

## Step 5 - Testing everything
If everything up to this point has gone well, all thatâ€™s left to do is start the program.
- Connect the SODAQ ExpLoRer to your computer using the usb cable.
- In the SODAQ ExpLoRer IDE ensure that the correct port is selected by going to `Tools > Port:` and check that the SODAQ ExpLoRer's is selected
- Ensure that the correct board is selected by going to `Tools > Board: > SODAQ SAMD (32-bits ARM Cortex-M0+) Boards > SODAQ ExpLoRer`.
- Finally click the arrow button in the top left to upload your code to the SODAQ ExpLoRer.

After it has finished uploading you can check the monitor at `Tools > Serial Monitor` to see if it is working.
You can also now go to the `Data` tab on your The Things Network application to see the data being sent.
